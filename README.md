# Global-Terrorism-Analysis
Exploratory data analysis on the Global Terrorism Database(GTD)

## Global Terrorism Analysis
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

## PATTERNS TO FIND

Starting by analyzing the basic history and patterns of terrorism is necessary for a better understanding of their standpoint in the world; keeping that in mind, the appropriate findings will follows:

* Number of terrorist attacks over the course of five decades

* The number of people killed and injured in terrorist attacks over the past five decades

* Most affected target types

* Terrorist arsenal and their effects 

Finding the deadliest terrorist groups with broad reach is an integral approach in an anti-terrorism-based analysis; the relevant findings will follows:

* Terrorist groups with the very high attack rates

* Terrorist groups which possess heavy arms and artillery

* Terrorist groups that have claimed the most lives

One of our main objectives, as we deliver the results to the Counter-Terrorism Committee, will be to identify patterns in terrorism using the region- and country-based approaches. As a result, the CTC will be better able to provide the afflicted nations or regions with financial aid and defensive equipment as needed. In light of that, the pertinent findings will follows:

* Presence of terrorism in various regions 

* Number of terrorist groups in each region

* Most vulnerable countries

* The number of lives lost in each country over the past five decades

## Conclusion

* Number of attacks , number of deaths and number of casualiaties due to terrorism all are on the rise over these years.

* Private citizens and property have been attacked the most. Evacuating people from warzones to safe zones must be taken care of in order to save innocent lives.

* Western Europe, Middle East and North Africa regions is the hotspot and the home for numerous terror groups. Uprooting the terror groups from their lairs in the Middle East and Western Europe should be the top priority.

* The Middle East and regions surrounding it such as South Asia and Africa also face the brunt of terrorism the most. CTC should focus more on such areas to erradicate terrorism.

* Iraq, Pakistan and India are the countries which have endured close to 40,000 attacks over a period of 5 decades. Iraq has lost the highest number of lives due to terrorism. Drastic protocols are to be adapted in order to reduce the intensity.

* Countries such as Nicaragua, Senegal and El-Salvador and most of the sub-Saharan African countries require support from the CTC as they are found to be defenseless against terrorism.

* Explosives and firearms are used the most as we know that they are lethal and can cause mass destruction. Efforts are to be made for eliminating the sources of financial support and weapons for terrorists.

* Taliban and ISIL are the most dangerous groups who carried out the highest number of attacks. Measures have to be taken in order to neutralize the Taliban, ISIL as these groups are found to be the deadliest amounting to more than 1,00,000 deaths in total.

These findings will help the Counter-Terrorism Committee to take adequate measures and guide them to understand where they should focus more.
